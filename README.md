It looks like you're encountering several issues while trying to push changes to your GitHub repository. The error message indicates a failure during the push process. Here are some steps to diagnose and fix the problem:

### 1. Check Network Connection
Ensure that your internet connection is stable. Network issues can cause interruptions during the push process.

### 2. Update Git
Make sure you have the latest version of Git installed. Older versions might have bugs that have been fixed in newer releases.

```sh
git --version
# If not the latest, update it
brew install git # For macOS
```

### 3. Check for Large Files
Large files can cause issues during the push. Check if there are any large files in your commit.

```sh
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.extension" # Replace with the actual file extension
```

### 4. Set Upstream Branch
Your branch's upstream seems to be missing. Set the upstream branch again.

```sh
git branch --unset-upstream
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
```

### 5. Retry Push
Retry pushing your changes.

```sh
git push origin main
```

### 6. Increase Buffer Size
Increase the buffer size to handle large pushes.

```sh
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
```

### 7. Check GitHub Permissions
Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to push to the repository. Verify your credentials and GitHub access tokens.

### 8. Repository Cleanup
Sometimes, the local repository can get into a corrupted state. Try cleaning up the repository.

```sh
git gc --prune=now
git remote prune origin
```

### 9. Debugging Sideband Issues
The sideband error might be related to an SSL issue. Disable SSL verification temporarily to see if it resolves the problem (not recommended for regular use).

```sh
git config --global http.sslVerify false
```

### 10. Detailed Logs
Enable detailed logging to get more information on the error.

```sh
GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 GIT_TRACE=1 git push origin main
```

### 11. Consider Alternative Tools
If the issue persists, consider using GitHub Desktop or another Git client to push your changes.

### Example Commands

```sh
# Unset upstream branch
git branch --unset-upstream

# Set upstream branch
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main

# Increase buffer size
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000

# Retry push
git push origin main
```
